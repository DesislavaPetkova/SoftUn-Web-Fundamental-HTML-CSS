						<p><strong>HTML<sub>5</sub> or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
							         It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like <"html">).</strong>
						</p>
						<p><i>Web browsers can read HTML files and compose them into visible or audible web pages.</i>
						</p>
						<p><pre>Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along 
							           with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.</pre></p>

						<p><em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. 
							   While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML
						</p>
						<p><b>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout,
						       colors, and fonts.</b> 
						</p>
						
						<p><u>Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications,
							   and user interfaces for many mobile applications. </u>

				<h1> 3. JavaScript </h1>   <img src="http://antloc.com/snanewtech/images/work/js_logo.gif" width="100px">
						<p><pre>    JavaScript  is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, 
							  whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, 
							  communicate asynchronously, 
							  and alter the document content that is displayed.</pre></p>
						<p>JavaScript<sup>2</sup> was originally developed by Brendan Eich, while working for Netscape Communications Corporation.While competing with Microsoft for user 
							  adoption of web technologies and platforms, Netscape considered their client-server offering a distributed OS with a portable version of Sun Microsystems'
							  Java providing an environment in which applets could be run.
